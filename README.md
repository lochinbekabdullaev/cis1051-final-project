# cis1051-final-project
Final project for CIS 1051 Fall 2024

This project consists of code for a discord bot that I wrote using the nextcord and aiohttp package.

FIRST IDEA:
At first, I wanted to create a discord bot that played music when a user inputs a youtube link in a slash command.
I want to use discord.py to write the code for it, but many of the videos were written in discord.js. So, I tried
following these youtube tutorials, however, each time I followed them, I always had an error, and I couldn't debug
it. In addition, the tutorials barely explained why they were writing this or that, and it was basically just copy
and paste, which I didn't want to do, and even if I did, there would be errors. All the youtube tutorials were also 
published a year or two ago, so they were outdated. Also, the code they were writing was very complicated for me. 
At this point, I felt like giving up and switching my idea to create a simple arcade game in python, but this was 
halfway point into the project due date, so I didn't know if I would be able to create something nice in the timeframe.
So I decided, you know what, I'll make something simple in my discord bot, and just go with it instead of torturing myself.

FINAL IDEA:
So this next idea was to create a discord bot that rolls a dice for a user from 1-6, and to display weather information
on a city in the United States. From the experience I had in my python class, and the difficulties I faced in the first idea,
I knew how to make a dice roll, which I did. Then I had to search up a youtube tutorial on how to create a bot that can
display weather info, and I found the perfect video. However, I had to use a different package called nextcord instead of
discord.py. But, luckily, both packages were similar, so no issues with that. The person writing the code was explaining 
what he was doing and it was helpful.

Overall, I am statisfied with what I created, and I am planning on developing bots in the future because I had much fun
in struggling and finding solutions to my problems. Also, I find it really cool coding a bot and it doing something, it 
is very satisfactory.


DISCORD BOT COMMANDS:

!dice - this command rolls a dice between 1-6, and it displays a dice emoji before the number. Ex. :game_die: 2

!weather {input city name here} - this command shows an embed with the weather for the city, humidity, temperature, and wind speeds.
